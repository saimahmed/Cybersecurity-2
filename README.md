# Cybersecurity-2
Capstone Project

This project consists of a scenario where a company has received a potential threat and I was brought in as the Security Consultant to investigate the cyber security incident. 

Scenario

Premium House Lights, Inc, an Ontario-based boutique company that sells and installs luxury lighting for upscale buildings, has received a suspicious extortion email to the
company’s Customer Support mailbox. Premium House Lights hired me as the Security Consultant to support them with the investigation of this potential incident.

The extortion email sent to the support mailbox states the following:
